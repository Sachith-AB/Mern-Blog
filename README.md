Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a dynamic approach to software development that prioritizes speed and flexibility without sacrificing quality. Unlike traditional waterfall methodologies that follow a linear process, RAD emphasizes iterative development cycles and rapid prototyping to quickly deliver functional software solutions.

In a RAD environment, cross-functional teams collaborate closely throughout the development lifecycle, including end-users, designers, developers, and testers. This collaborative approach allows for rapid feedback loops, ensuring that the software meets evolving user needs and requirements.
